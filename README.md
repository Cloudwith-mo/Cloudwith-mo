# TaxFlowsAI Prototype

This repository hosts **TaxFlowsAI**, a small experiment in building a tax portal with AI features. It is not production ready but gives you an idea of how income and deduction data might be captured and summarized.

## Purpose

The goal is to test different ways of providing tax insights to users using lightweight scripts. While the portal lets you enter test data and see a summary, it should only be used locally for demonstration or learning.

## Running the Prototype

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run `python taxflowsai.py` to start the server and open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`.

For more detailed instructions, see [TAX_PORTAL_README.md](TAX_PORTAL_README.md).

## Basic Usage

Once the server is running you can add income and deduction items. The application will display a summary of your entries and is intended to be extended with AI-driven suggestions.
