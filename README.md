## Hi there 👋

**Cloudwith-mo/Cloudwith-mo** 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
1. A book blog. Every single day after I read, I'll submit an entry and when I'm done with the book, AI will give me summary from my daily entries. 
2. A journal entry. I like to handwrite my journal entries, I'm creating a tool that'll allow me to uupload a picture of my hand written journal and turn in into text and give me a summary. 
- 💬 Ask me about Cloud & IT.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to read sci-fi books.


## Running the sample app

The repository now includes a small Flask application that demonstrates using
SQLite for persistence and [Flask-Login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/) for
basic authentication. The app stores users, documents and processing statuses in
`app.db` by default.

### Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` to register a user, log in and create documents.
