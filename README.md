# TaxFlowsAI Prototype

This repository hosts **TaxFlowsAI**, a small experiment in building a tax portal with AI features. It is meant for local testing only.

## Running the Flask demo

Install the dependencies and start the app from the repository root. The application uses SQLite for development and will create `tax_portal.db` on first run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tax_portal/app.py
```

The file `tax_portal/app.py` expects the shared `templates/` and `static/` directories in the parent folder.
